# grumble-solver

Solver for the french game [grumble.fr](https://www.grumble.fr/)

Please don't mind the dirty code. That was more a proof of concept than anything serious. Nevertheless, feel free to improve the code if you feel like it (there's plenty of space for optimization!)

I only have tested on Linux, but this should work flawlessly on windows if you [install the `grep` command](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm). (Yeah, code is nasty...)

### Requirements : 
- Python 3+
- python module numpy

### Usage :

Put each letter followed by its number of occurrences, in sequence between quotes


Example usage : 
```bash
$ python3 grumble.py "s2e2i2o1l2n1t1v1a1j1r1c1"

[...]
